## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.2] - 2025-11-01

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Removed alpha channel from PNG screenshots - App Store does not accept images with alpha channels
- All generated PNG files now saved as RGB (without alpha) instead of RGBA
- Previously, PNG screenshots included an alpha channel that would cause App Store Connect to reject the images

### Added
- Test to verify PNG files don't contain alpha channel
- Test to verify JPEG files are properly saved as RGB

### Changed
- Unified image saving logic to always convert RGBA canvas to RGB before saving
- Both PNG and JPEG outputs now use the same RGB conversion process

### Testing
- All 310 tests passing
- New tests specifically verify no alpha channel in generated images
- All linters passing (black, isort, flake8, mypy)

## [0.10.1] - 2025-10-31

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed device field default value bug that was silently overriding user-specified device values from YAML files
- The `device` field now properly requires explicit configuration instead of using a hardcoded default
- Users must ensure their YAML configs include the `device` field inside the `project:` section

### Changed
- Made `device` field required in `ProjectInfo` to prevent configuration issues
- Updated all test fixtures to include explicit device field
- All 308 tests passing

### Testing
- Verified fix with real-world Boxy YAML config files
- Confirmed proper validation errors when device field is missing
- All linters passing (black, isort, flake8, mypy)

## [0.10.0] - 2025-10-31

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Simplified configuration structure - `device` and `output_size` moved from per-screenshot to project level
- `device` now set once in `project:` section (default: "iPhone 15 Pro Portrait")
- `output_size` now set once in `project:` section (default: "iPhone6_9")
- One YAML file = one device/size combination for clearer project organization
- Relaxed mypy type checking configuration for better maintainability
- All linters passing (black, isort, flake8, mypy)

### Added
- App Store standard screenshot sizes with friendly names (iPhone6_9, iPhone6_7, iPadPro12_9, etc.)
- `appstore_sizes.json` with 8 predefined screenshot dimensions
- `kou list-sizes` command to display all available App Store sizes with descriptions
- Named size resolution system - use "iPhone6_9" or custom tuple [1320, 2868]
- Automatic size validation and conversion via Pydantic validators

### Fixed
- Screenshot output now matches App Store required dimensions (screen-only, not full frame with bezel)
- Canvas sizing now uses project-level `output_size` instead of frame PNG dimensions
- Type annotation compatibility issues across codebase

### Migration Guide
**Old config** (multiple devices per file):
```yaml
project:
  name: "My App"
  output_dir: "output"
devices:
  - "iPhone 15 Pro Portrait"
  - "iPad Pro 12.9-inch Portrait"
```

**New config** (single device per file):
```yaml
project:
  name: "My App"
  output_dir: "output"
  device: "iPhone 15 Pro Portrait"
  output_size: "iPhone6_9"
```

For multiple devices, create separate YAML files (e.g., `iphone-6-9.yaml`, `ipad-pro.yaml`)

## [0.9.0] - 2025-10-31

### Added
- Localized asset support with hybrid approach (convention-based and explicit mapping)
- `resolve_localized_asset()` function for automatic language-specific asset resolution
- Convention-based asset resolution using `{lang}/` directory pattern
- Explicit per-language asset mapping with dict format `{"en": "path/en.png", "es": "path/es.png"}`
- Fallback chain: explicit mapping → lang directory → base_lang directory → direct path
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests for localized assets
- Dependency analyzer support for dict-based asset tracking

### Changed
- `ContentItem.asset` field now accepts both string and dict formats for maximum flexibility
- Enhanced asset resolution to work seamlessly with multi-language projects

## [0.8.4] - 2025-10-30

### Fixed
- Device frame rendering with automatic screen bounds detection using flood fill algorithm
- Asset overflow at rounded corners with anti-aliased alpha channel masking
- Blank space between assets and device frames
- Smooth rounded corners preserved with alpha threshold of 50 for bezel separation

### Changed
- Replaced manual screen_bounds metadata with automatic detection
- Improved mask generation using alpha channel inversion instead of binary flood fill
- Enhanced type annotations and fixed all linting issues (black, isort, flake8, mypy)

### Added
- Comprehensive tests for flood fill algorithm and anti-aliased masking
- Test coverage for automatic screen bounds detection and aspect ratio preservation

## [0.8.3] - 2024-12-12

- DeviceMapper loads dimensions dynamically from Sizes.json instead of hardcoded values
- CLI guidance now shows correct `kou generate` command instead of `kou`
- Updated example configs (basic_example.yaml, advanced_example.yaml) to new schema
- Updated tests to expect device subdirectories in output structure
- App Store upload now works correctly for both single-language and multi-language projects
